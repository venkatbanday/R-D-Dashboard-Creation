R&amp;D Dashboard Creation
**Innovate R&D Project**

One impactful system I built from scratch was a centralised project and financial tracking dashboard for our Innovate R&D projects. Prior to this, our team managed budgets, timesheets, and milestone tracking using disconnected spreadsheets and emails, which resulted in version control issues, delays in claims, and a lack of visibility across workstreams.

**Steps Taken:**

I designed and implemented a custom Google Sheets-based dashboard, integrated with data from timesheets, supplier invoices, and financial systems like Xero. The dashboard included:

- Automated tracking of budget versus actual spend
- Timesheet summaries for each work package and partner
- Visual timelines and milestone completion indicators
- Alerts for approaching deadlines and unclaimed costs

**Why It Mattered:**

- It provided everyone, from finance to technical leads, with real-time visibility into project health.
- It reduced quarterly claim preparation time by over 50%.
- It improved the accuracy and audit-readiness of our financial submissions.
- It fostered accountability across teams and partners, as performance and cost tracking became transparent and accessible.

The system became our primary tool for both internal reviews and meetings with Innovate UK's monitoring officers. Not only did it make our team more effective, but it also increased trust and efficiency in multi-partner collaborations.
